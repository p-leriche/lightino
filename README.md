## Lightino lessons and resources

Lightino (https://lightino.org) is a fidget spinner incorporating an Arduino Pro Micro and 8 RGB LEDS, great for teaching kids to code using the Arduino IDE. In the UK it's distributed by https://coolcomponents.co.uk

I found the resources which came with it somewhat disappointing so wrote my own. Here you will find a suite of lessons, required student files, and example answers. There's also an stl file for 3D printing an improved boss.
