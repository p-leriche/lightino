## Lightino lessons and resources

Lightino (https://lightino.org) is a fidget spinner incorporating an Arduino Pro Micro and 8 RGB LEDS, great for teaching kids to code using the Arduino IDE. The designer and owner of the Lightino project is www.makerstorage.com and the product page is https://makerstorage.com/index.php?id_product=29&controller=product. It's distributed in the UK by https://coolcomponents.co.uk

I found the resources which came with it a little limited for my purposes so I wrote my own. Here you will find a suite of lessons, required student files, and example answers. There's also an stl file for 3D printing an improved boss.
